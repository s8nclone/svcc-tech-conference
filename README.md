# tech-conference-app

A simple Tech conference app for an organization that lets you view speakers, when and where they will be speaking. Gives users the ability to favorite speakers, add and delete speakers from the list. It also allows filtering through speakers by year and by their name. You can choose to show the sessions for each speaker and change the theme of the page as well.

A simple and rather unsafe Login functionality was implemented using Higher Order components, that allows you to add spakers only if you are logged in as a user.
