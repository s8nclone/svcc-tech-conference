# tech-conference-app

A simple webapp for an organization's tech conference that lets you view information about it's speakers. It gives users the ability to favorite speakers, add and delete speakers from the list. It also allows filtering through speakers by year and by their name. You can choose to show the sessions for each speaker and change the theme of the page as well.

A simple and rather unsafe Login functionality was implemented using Higher Order components, that allows you to add spakers only if you are logged in as a user.

Speaker's data is fetched from local server using NextJs's api routes.

Built with -
 -NextJs
 -BootStrap v5.3
 -Icons from font Awesome
